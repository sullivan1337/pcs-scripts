# Prisma Cloud Alert Rules

## Used to automatically go in, and re-enable an Alert Rule with the new Policies added since creation

What these will do will scan ALL policies within your Prisma Cloud environment, and then depending on the Severity (Low, Medium, High), will add ALL of the selected Severity to the existing Alert Rule.
