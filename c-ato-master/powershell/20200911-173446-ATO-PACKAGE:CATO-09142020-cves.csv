CVE,CVSS,PackageName,Status,Description,Tag
NODE-SECURITY-568,9,constantinople,fixed in >=3.1.1,Versions of `constantinople` prior to 3.1.1 are vulnerable to a sandbox bypass which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
CVE-2019-15847,7.5,gcc,fixed in 9.3.0-r0,The POWER9 backend in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) before version 10 could optimize multiple calls of the __builtin_darn intrinsic into a single call thus reducing the entropy of the random number generator. This occurred because a volatile operation was not specified. For example within a single execution of a program the output of every __builtin_darn() call may be the same.
CVE-2020-8116,7.3,dot-prop,fixed in >=4.2.1 <5.0.0 || >=5.1.1,Prototype pollution vulnerability in dot-prop npm package versions before 4.2.1 and versions 5.x before 5.1.1 allows an attacker to add arbitrary properties to JavaScript language constructs such as objects.
CVE-2015-8857,9.8,uglify-js,fixed in >= 2.4.24,The uglify-js package before 2.4.24 for Node.js does not properly account for non-boolean values when rewriting boolean expressions which might allow attackers to bypass security mechanisms or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging improperly rewritten Javascript.
CVE-2015-8858,7.5,uglify-js,fixed in >=2.6.0,The uglify-js package before 2.6.0 for Node.js allows attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input in a parse call aka a \"regular expression denial of service (ReDoS).\"
CVE-2020-15095,5.5,npm,fixed in >=6.14.6,Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.14.6 are vulnerable to an information exposure vulnerability through log files. The CLI supports URLs like \"<protocol>://[<user>[:<password>]@]<hostname>[:<port>][:][/]<path>\". The password value is not redacted and is printed to stdout and also to any generated log files.
NODE-SECURITY-785,1,clean-css,fixed in >=4.1.11,Version of `clean-css` prior to 4.1.11 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). Untrusted input may cause catastrophic backtracking while matching regular expressions. This can cause the application to be unresponsive leading to Denial of Service.
NODE-SECURITY-1179,1,minimist,fixed in >=0.2.1 <1.0.0 || >=1.2.3,Affected versions of `minimist` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. Arguments are not properly sanitized allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object` causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.   Parsing the argument `--__proto__.y=Polluted` adds a `y` property with value `Polluted` to all objects. The argument `--__proto__=Polluted` raises and uncaught error and crashes the application.   This is exploitable if attackers have control over the arguments being passed to `minimist`.
