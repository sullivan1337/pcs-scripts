# pcs-compute-report-generator
This project creates HTML or PDF reports for Vulnerability and Compliance data pulled from a Prisma Cloud Compute (formerly Twistlock) instance.

## Setup
First clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/timekillerj/pcs-compute-report-generator.git
```

It is recommended you create a virtual environment to keep installed python packages isolated from the rest of your system:

```
cd pcs-compute-report-generator
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate it:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Next you will need to install the required python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you will need to install [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) for your platform.

## Environment Variables
To fun reports with this script you will need 3 environment variables:

| Environment Variable     | Description                               |
|----------------------    |-------------------------------------------|
| COMPUTE_CONSOLE_ADDRESS  | Compute Console address                   |
| COMPUTE_ACCESS_KEY       | Your username for the instance            |
| COMPUTE_SECRET_KEY       | Your password                             |
